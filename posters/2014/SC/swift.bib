However, these frameworks use coordination languages that are insufficiently expressive for many classes of computation, including iterative and recursive algorithms. To address this problem, and generalise previous approaches, we introduce Skywriting: a Turing-powerful, purely-functional script language for describing distributed computations. In this paper, we introduce the main features of Skywriting, and outline our novel cooperative task farming execution engine.}},

    Abstract = {MapReduce and its variants have been highly successful in implementing large-scale data intensive applications on clusters of unreliable machines. However, most of these systems are built around an acyclic data flow programming model that is not suitable for other popular applications. In this paper, we focus on one such class of applications: those that reuse a working set of data across multiple parallel operations. This includes many iterative machine learning algorithms, as well as interactive data analysis environments. We propose a new framework called Spark that supports these applications while maintaining the scalability and fault-tolerance properties of MapReduce. To achieve these goals, Spark introduces a data abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a 39 GB dataset with sub-second response time.}

We argue that high-level task or thread abstractions and a common global scheduler cannot provide effective library composition. Instead, the operating system should expose unvirtualized processing resources that can be shared cooperatively between parallel libraries within an application. In this paper, we describe a system that standardizes and facilitates the exchange of these unvirtualized processing resources between libraries.}
