High-energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) is an important method for
determining the grain structure of metals.  It is performed at
specialized light sources that produce .  Typically, the scientist
applies for a week of beam time and spends that time gathering data.
High-performance computing (HPC) is rarely if ever applied during the
week of beam time.  Applying HPC has the potential to greatly reduce
errors.  It may provide feedback to the scientist during the run, to
improve the quality of results and the utility of precious beam time.
Most importantly, it will speed the process of scientific discovery,
even if the HPC is applied after beam time. In this work, we present
an HEDM application that spans a small cluster and the Blue Gene/Q at
ANL.  It uses up to 64K cores of the BG/Q to provide near real-time
feedback to APS beam users.
